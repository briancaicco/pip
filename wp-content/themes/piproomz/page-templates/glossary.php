Traders looking to take advantage of this interest rate differential would buy NZD and sell JPY, or be long NZD/JPY.

In practical terms, if you buy a CFD at $10 then sell it at $11, you will receive the $1 difference. Conversely, if you went short on the trade and sold at $10 before buying back at $11, you would pay the $1 difference.
